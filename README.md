# Swank Clojure

[Swank Clojure](http://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure) is a
server that allows SLIME (the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for
Emacs) to connect to Clojure projects.

## Usage

The simplest way is to just <tt>jack-in</tt> from an existing project
using [Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen):

* Install clojure-mode either from
  [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org) or from
  [git](http://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode).
* <tt>lein plugin install swank-clojure 1.3.3</tt>
* From inside a project, invoke <tt>M-x clojure-jack-in</tt>

That's all it takes! There are no extra install steps beyond
clojure-mode on the Emacs side and the swank-clojure plugin on the
Leiningen side. In particular be sure you don't have any other
versions of Slime installed; see "Troubleshooting" below.

## SLIME Commands

Commonly-used SLIME commands:

* **M-.**: Jump to the definition of a var
* **C-c TAB**: Autocomplete symbol at point
* **C-x C-e**: Eval the form under the point
* **C-c C-k**: Compile the current buffer
* **C-c C-l**: Load current buffer and force required namespaces to reload
* **C-M-x**: Compile the whole top-level form under the point.
* **C-c S-i**: Inspect a value
* **C-c C-m**: Macroexpand the call under the point
* **C-c C-d C-d**: Look up documentation for a var
* **C-c C-z**: Switch from a Clojure buffer to the repl buffer
* **C-c M-p**: Switch the repl namespace to match the current buffer
* **C-c C-w c**: List all callers of a given function

Pressing "v" on a stack trace a debug buffer will jump to the file and
line referenced by that frame if possible.

Note that SLIME was designed to work with Common Lisp, which has a
distinction between interpreted code and compiled code. Clojure has no
such distinction, so the load-file functionality is overloaded to add
<code>:reload-all</code> behaviour.

## Alternate Usage

There are other ways to use Swank for different specific
circumstances.  For each of these methods you will have to install the
slime and slime-repl Emacs Lisp libraries manually as outlined in
"Connecting with SLIME" below.

### Standalone Server

If you just want a standalone swank server with no third-party
libraries, you can use the shell wrapper that Leiningen installs for
you:

    $ lein plugin install swank-clojure 1.3.3
    $ ~/.lein/bin/swank-clojure

    M-x slime-connect

If you put <tt>~/.lein/bin</tt> on your <tt>$PATH</tt> it's even more
convenient.

### Manual Swank in Project

You can also start a swank server by hand from inside your project.
You'll need to have installed using <tt>lein plugin
install</tt>, then launch the server from the shell:

    $ lein swank # you can specify PORT and HOST optionally

If you're using Maven, add this to your pom.xml under the
\<dependencies\> section:

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>swank-clojure</groupId>
      <artifactId>swank-clojure</artifactId>
      <version>1.3.3</version>
    </dependency>
```

Then you can launch a swank server like so:

    $ mvn clojure:swank

Note that due to a bug in clojure-maven-plugin, you currently cannot
include it as a test-scoped dependency; it must be compile-scoped. You
also cannot change the port from Maven; it's hard-coded to 4005.

### Embedding

You can embed Swank Clojure in your project, start the server from
within your own code, and connect via Emacs to that instance:

```clj
(ns my-app
  (:require [swank.swank]))
(swank.swank/start-server) ;; optionally takes :host/:port keyword args
```

To make this work in production, swank-clojure needs to be in
<tt>:dependencies</tt> in project.clj in addition to being installed
as a user-level plugin. If you do this, you can also start the server
directly from the "java" command-line launcher if you AOT-compile it
and specify "swank.swank" as your main class.

## Connecting with SLIME

If you're not using the <tt>M-x clojure-jack-in</tt> method mentioned
above, you'll have to install SLIME yourself. The easiest way is to
use package.el. If you are using Emacs 24 or the
[Emacs Starter Kit](http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit),
then you have it already. If not, get it
[from Emacs's own repository](http://bit.ly/pkg-el23).

Then add Marmalade as an archive source in your Emacs config:

```lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
```

Evaluate that, then run <kbd>M-x package-refresh-contents</kbd> to
pull in the latest source lists. Then you can do <kbd>M-x
package-install</kbd> and choose <kbd>slime-repl</kbd>.

When you perform the installation, you will see warnings related to
the byte-compilation of the packages. This is **normal**; the packages
will work just fine even if there are problems byte-compiling it upon
installation.

Then you should be able to connect to the swank server you launched:

    M-x slime-connect

It will prompt you for your host (usually localhost) and port. It may
also warn you that your SLIME version doesn't match your Swank
version; this should be OK.

To get syntax highlighting in your repl buffer, use this elisp:

```lisp
(add-hook 'slime-repl-mode-hook
          (defun clojure-mode-slime-font-lock ()
            (let (font-lock-mode)
              (clojure-mode-font-lock-setup))))
```

## Troubleshooting

Currently having multiple versions of swank-clojure on the classpath
can cause issues when running `lein swank` or `lein jack-in`. It's
recommended to not put swank-clojure in your `:dev-dependencies` but
have users run `lein plugin install` to have it installed globally for
all projects. This also means that people hacking on your project
won't have to pull it in if they are not Emacs users.

It's also possible for some packages to pull in old versions of
swank-clojure transitively, so check the `lib/` directory if
you are having issues. In particular, Incanter is known to exhibit
this problem. Judicious use of `:exclusions` make it work:

```clj
   :dependencies [[incanter "1.2.3" :exclusions [swank-clojure]]]
```

Currently `M-x clojure-jack-in` expects that `lein jack-in $PORT`
emits no output other than elisp. If you have hooks causing other
messages to be emitted or have `:warn-on-reflection` turned on this
could cause errors bootstrapping.

Having old versions of SLIME installed either manually or using a
system-wide package manager like apt-get may cause issues. Also the
official CVS version of SLIME is not supported; it often breaks
compatibility with Clojure. In addition, the `slime-clj` packages are
incompatible with swank-clojure.

It's possible to have Emacs configured for both Common Lisp and
Clojure if you defer loading of Slime until it's needed.
[This issue](https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure/issues/66)
has details on how that is done. It's not possible to have a single
instance of Emacs connect to both though.

Swank-clojure and SLIME are only tested with GNU Emacs; forks such as
Aquamacs and XEmacs may work but are not officially supported.

On Mac OS X, Emacs sessions launched from the GUI don't always respect
your configured $PATH. If Emacs can't find `lein`, you may need to
give it some help. The quickest way is probably to add this elisp to
your config:

```lisp
(setenv "PATH" (shell-command-to-string "echo $PATH"))
```

## How it Works

Swank Clojure is simply a server that communicates over the Slime
protocol with an Emacs process. As such it runs in a JVM process,
usually launched by Leiningen. Slime is a client that runs within
Emacs to communicate with Swank. You can start the two of them
separately as explained in "Connecting with SLIME" above, but `M-x
clojure-jack-in` will send the elisp code for Slime to the Emacs
process to ensure that it uses a version of Slime that is compatible
with that version of Swank. Once the Swank server is finished loading,
it sends a signal to Emacs to connect to it.

## Debugger

You can set repl-aware breakpoints using <tt>swank.core/break</tt>.
For now, see
[Hugo Duncan's blog](http://hugoduncan.org/post/2010/swank_clojure_gets_a_break_with_the_local_environment.xhtml)
for an explanation of this excellent feature.

[CDT](http://georgejahad.com/clojure/swank-cdt.html) (included in
Swank Clojure since 1.4.0) is a more comprehensive debugging tool
that includes support for stepping, seting breakpoints, catching
exceptions, and eval clojure expressions in the context of the current
lexical scope.

## TODO

* show method argument names in slime inspector (theoretically possible?)
* show better metadata on functions in inspector

## Community

The [swank-clojure mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/swank-clojure) 
and clojure channel on Freenode are the best places to bring up
questions/issues.

Contributions are preferred as either Github pull requests or using
"git format-patch". Please use standard indentation with no tabs,
